2 kinds of ships:
- "cargo ships" == worker nodes
    - have containers == running apps
    - each one has "captain" == kubelet
        - agent that runs on each node on the cluster,
        - listens to instructions from the kube-apiserver and deplys or destroys containers as required
        - kubeapiserver periodically fetches status reports from the kubelets to monitor the status of nodes and the containers on them
    - container runtime engine: 
        - eg: Docker
        - must be installed on all the nodes, including master node
    - kube-proxy (on each node)
        - allows diff nodes and the containers on them to comm with eachother, e.g. backend app on one node can talk to db on another
- "control ships" == master node
    - manage the loading of containers onto the worker nodes
    - done using "control plane components"
        - etcd cluster:
            - key-value store
            - maintain information about the diff ships, what container is on each ship, when was it loaded, etc
        - "crane" == scheduler: puts containers on different ships, based on container's resource requirements, worker's capacity, any other constraints s.a. taints + tolerations, node affinity pools, etc.
        - controller-manager
            - node controller
            - replication controller
        - all^ managed by kube-apiserver, allows them to communicate
            - exposes k8s api that allows external users to perform mgt operations on the cluster
            - also lets diff components of master node comm with eachother
