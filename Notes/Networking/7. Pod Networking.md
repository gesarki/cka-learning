# Pod Networking
Networking Model:
- Every POD should have an IP address
- Every POD hsould be able to communicate with every other POD in the same node
- every POD should be able to communicate with every other POD on other nodes without NAT

CNI takes care of this
- kubelet runs on every node
    - `--cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d`
    - `--cni-bin-dir=/etc/cni/bin`
    - `--network-plugin=cni`
    - `./net_script.sh add <container> <namespace>` where net_script is your cni plugin, does all the required steps when init'ing a pod

# CNI in k8s
```bash
$ ls /opt/cni/bin # path with our CNI binaries, passed to kubelet above
bridge dhcp flannel host-local ipvlan loopback ... weave-ipam weave-net weave-plugin-2.2.1
$
$ ls /etc/cni/net.d # where kubelet looks to find out which plugin needs to be used
10-bridge.conf
```

# Weaveworks
- puts an agent on each node
    - they all communicate with eachother 
    - each agent stores a topology of the cluster setup
    - know the pods and the IPs on the other nodes
- creates it's own bridge on the node called weave and assigns ip addresses to each network
- any packet that needs to go from one pod to another is intercepted by the weaveworks agent, transported to the right node, and converted back to the original packet at the target node's weaveworks agent

## deploy Weave
If the k8s cluster is set up already with all the networking working, weave can be deployed with `k apply -f`
- `k apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s_version=1.20.0`
- deploys a daemonset
