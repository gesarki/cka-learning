# CNI
Container Networking Interface

- Docker, Kubernetes, Rocket, Mesos all have to solve the same problem of connecting containers together

## bridge
- standard tool that does all this for you
- used by k8s, docker, mesos, rocket, etc.

- `bridge add <cid> <namespace>

## CNI
CNI is a set of standards that define how programs should be developed to solve network challenges in container runtime environments
- the program itself is a "plugin"
- bridge is a plugin for CNI
- CNI defines how the plugin should be developed and how the runtime (k8s, docker, mesos) should invoke them

Any runtime should be able to work with any plugin

**Docker doesn't work with CNI**
- docker has it's own - CNM

## K8s working with docker
- `docker run --network none nginx`
- `bridge add 2e34dcf34 /var/run/netns/2e34dcf34`       k8s calls brdige directly
