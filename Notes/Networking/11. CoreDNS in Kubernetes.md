# CoreDNS in Kubernetes
- k8s uses a central dns server instead of modifying the /etc/hosts file on every node
- CoreDNS is the recommended plugin for this starting with k8s 1.12

## Configuration
- /etc/coredns/Corefile
- contains a k8s "plugin"
    - set top level domain name
    - `pods insecure` means create records for pods too
    - speciy /etc/resolv.conf file
- passed into the pod as a configmap object
    - `k get configmap -n kube-system`

## kube-dns
- **service**
- the service through which Coredns is available to the other pods in the cluster
- named `kube-dns`
- ip address of this service is configured in the /etc/resolv.conf file on all pods
    - done automatically when pods are created
    - kubelet
        - cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
        - contains the IP of the DNS server
- resolv.conf file also has the search config for it to add <namespace>.svc.cluster.local when you curl my-service
    - doesn't have the POD names (.namespace.pod.cluster.local)
        - need to specify the full FQDN (fully quantified domain name) of the pod
