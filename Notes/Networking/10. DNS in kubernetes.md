# DNS in kubernetes

### Example
- 3-node cluster
    - each with a node name, IP addr - managed by cloud, not our concern

- 2 pods
    - test
    - web
- web has service
    - web-service: 10.107.37.188
- *kube-dns* creates an entry mapping web-service to 10.107.37.188
- within the cluster, any pod can now reach the service using it's service name
    - `curl http://web-service` if you're in the same ns
    - `curl http://web-service.apps` if you're in a different namespace

- for each namespace, the dns server creates a **sub-domain** (the namespace name)
    - and each service ("svc")
    - and the root ("cluster.local")

- fully qualified domain name:
    - web-service.apps.svc.cluster.local

## Records for pods?
- can have k8s do this, but need to explicitly tell it to
- will replace IP addr dots with dashes
    - 10-244-2-5
    - curl http://10-244-2-5.apps.pod.cluster.local
