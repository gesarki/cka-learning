# DNS
## Just for your host
- If you want to map 192.168.1.11 to the "db" name
- modify your system's /etc/hosts file
```hosts
# /etc/hosts
192.168.1.11        db
```
- now `ping db` resolves ðŸ˜Š
    - or `ssh` or `curl`
- *note* this entry doesn't have to match the result of running `hostname` on the 192.168.1.11 host

What about when you have a big network and some hosts can change their IPs sometimes?
- can't keep updating every host's `/etc/hosts` file

## Add a nameserver
- create a DNS server on your network, ip 192.168.1.100
    - it has the mappings you used to have in your `/etc/hosts` file
- in every host on your network specify a nameserver for it to get DNS-IP mappings
```
# /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver          192.168.1.100
```

## Choose order of checking /etc/hosts and DNS server?
- modify /etc/nsswitch.conf
```
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
...
hosts:              files dns       # this means check local files first, then dns server
```

## If name isn't in /etc/hosts or DNS server?
- facebook.com is in neither
    - ping facebook.com will fail
- edit /etc/resolv.conf to add a public dns server (e.g. google's)
```
# /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver          192.168.1.100
nameserver          8.8.8.8             # Google's NS
```
- now `ping www.facebook.com` works

## Domain names anatomy
- `.` is root
- `.com` = Top Level Domain (TLD)
- `google` = domain name assigned to google
- `www` = subdomain
    - `drive`, `mail`, `maps` are all also subdomains

## Domain name caching
- instead of going through the whole chain when performing a DNS lookup every time
    - i.e. root DNS -> .com dns -> google DNS -> IP of apps.gooogle.com
- your network router can cache it for a while

## how about your own organization
- what if I want `mail` to resolve to mail.mycompany.com without having to type it out fully?
- edit the /etc/resolv.conf file
```
# /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver          192.168.1.100
search              mycompany.com           # tells it to try appending .mycompany.com to lookups by default
```
- host is still smart enough to not search google.com.mycompany.com when you already specify a domain name

## record types
- A
    - maps a host name to an IP address
- AAAA
    - maps a host name to an IPv6 address
- CNAME
    - maps a name to another name
    - e.g.: youtu.be and youtube.com should both go to youtube.com

## nslookup and dig
- `nslookup www.google.com`
- `dig www.google.com`
- query a hostname from a DNS server
    - returns it's IP address
- *note* Checks the DNS server first!! Ignores the local /etc/hosts file at all

## CoreDNS
- an opensource DNS server you can download from github
- listens on port 53 automatically
- can configure it's host mappings in the /etc/hosts file
    - need to tell it to use that file
    - edit it's config file named `Corefile`

- *Used in k8s by default*
