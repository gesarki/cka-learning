# IP Address Management - Weave
- How are the virtual bridge networks in the nodes assigned IP subnets?
- How are the pods assigned an IP?
- Where is this info stored?
- who's responsible for ensuring there are no duplicate IPs assigned?

According to CNI:
- it's the responsibility of the plugin to manage IP addr assignments to PODs

## CNI config
- cni config file passed to kubelet with `--cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d` specifies
    - ipam tool to use
        - either DHCP or host-local
    - also what subnet to use

## Weave 
- subnet: 10.32.0.0/12
- that's 10.32.0.1 -> 10.47.255.254
    -  > 1 million IPs!
- from this range the agents decide to split the IPs equally between the nodes
