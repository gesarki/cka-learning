# Service Networking

## Services

### ClusterIP
- expose a pod to other nodes on the cluster

### NodePort
- expose a pod to outside world (on port on all nodes in cluster) + other nodes on the cluster

## kube-proxy
- when you create a svc every node can access a POD it via the svc's IP addr
    - this IP addr is specified in the range passed to kube-apiserver's `--service-cluster-ip-range` flag
    - default: 10.0.0.0/24
    - this shouldn't overlap with the pod CIDR range provided to your CNI plugin
        - given either in the CNI config file or the logs of the plugin PODs
- this is possible with IP forwarding rules on every node
    - says any traffic going to the IP of the svc should go to the IP of the POD
- this is handled by **kube-proxy**

### proxy-mode
- tool that kube-proxy uses to make the rules
    - userspace or iptables or ipvs
    - default: iptables

- commands to view this:
    - `k get pods -o wide`
        - to see pod's IPs
    - `k get svc`
        - to see clusterIP of svcs
    - `iptables -L -t nat | grep <svc-name>`
        - to see ip table rules related to the svc created
