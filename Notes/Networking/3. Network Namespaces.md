# Network Namespaces
- `ip netns add red`
- `ip netns add blue`
- you can isolate different network interface configurations on one host with network namespaces
    - red and blue will have different
- `ip -n red link` 
    - same as `ip link` except runs in the `red` namespace
    - also: `ip -n red arp` and `ip -ns route`
- each namespace has it's own IP, routing, etc.

## Connect network NSs
- `ip link add veth-red type veth peer name veth-blue`                   create "network interfaces"
- `ip link set veth-red netns red`                                       "attach" network interface to red
- `ip link set veth-blue netns blue`                                     "attach" network interface to blue

- `ip -n red addr add 192.168.15.1 dev veth-red`                   assign IP address to the network interface in red's ns
- `ip -n blue addr add 192.168.15.2 dev veth-red`                  Same for blue but diff IP address

- `ip -n red link set veth-red up`                                 bring up the interfaces
- `ip -n blue link set veth-blue up` 

- `ip netns exec red ping 192.168.15.2`                            pinging blue's IP as red works!

- `ip netns exec red arp`                                          blue shows up on red's routing table


## Connect many namespaces using linux brigde
- `ip link add v-net-0 type bridge`                                 adds another interface to our host - virtual network
    - appears in output of `ip link` cmd
- `ip link set dev v-net-0 up`                                      to bring up new interface

- `ip -n red link del veth-red`                                     delete old virtual interface

- `ip link add veth-red type veth peer name veth-red-br`            create new virtual "network interface" for red->bridge
- `ip link add veth-blue type veth peer name veth-blue-br`          same for blue->bridge

- `ip link set veth-red netns red`                                  connect one end to red
- `ip link set veth-red-br master v-net-0`                          connect master end to our virtual network
    - same for blue

- `ip -n red addr add 192.168.15.1 dev veth-red`                   assign IP address to the network interface in red's ns
    - same for blue except 192.168.15.2

- `ip -n red link set veth-red up`                                 bring up the interfaces
    - same for blue

### Connect from host to virtual network and v hosts
- v-net-0 interface is just an interface on our host
- `ip addr add 192.168.15.5/24 dev v-net-0`                         assign host an IP addr for that host

- `ping 192.168.15.1`                                               pinging red's IP from host works!

## Connect virtual network to outside world
- we will need to use our localhost

- `ip netns exec blue ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.15.5`     tell blue to route all traffic to 192.168.1.* through the hosts v-net-0

- ping still won't work for external IPs because host has to allow IP forwarding
- `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.15.0/24 -j MASQUERADE`     anyone receiving these packets outside will think you're coming from the host

- `ip -n blue ping 192.168.1.3`                                         works now!

## connect virtual network to internet (all IPs)
- `ip netns exec blue ip route add default via 192.168.15.5`            add default route to 192.168.15.5

- `ip -n blue ping 8.8.8.8`                                             works now!
