# Docker Networking

- when you run `docker run nginx` it creates an internal virtual network "bridge"
    - network has address 172.17.0.0
    - each device (docker container) on the network gets 172.17.0.2 - 172.17.0.X

- `docker network ls`
    - shows network name "bridge"
    - on host, it shows up as "docker0"
    - docker also uses the command `ip link add ...` to create this network
    - down by default

- when a new container is created, docker creates a network ns for it just like in prev lecture
    - creates a network interface on it and attaches it to the "bridge" or "docker0" network interface
    - also assigns IP to the network inerface in each container

- *This means all containers can talk to eachother by default!* 

- when you run an nginx container in docker and it hosts and http server on port 80
    - you can access it from another container or from the host container at 172.17.0.1:80
    - can't reach it from the host
- when you run `docker run nginx -p 8080:80`
    - you can reach it from host!
        - curl http://192.168.1.10:8080
    - docker just adds an iptables forwarding route on your host to the DOCKER chain
    - `iptables -t nat -A DOCKER  -j DNAT --dport 8080 --to-destination 172.17.0.3:80`
    - can see this under `iptables -nvL -t nat`
