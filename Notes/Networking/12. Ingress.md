# Ingress 

## Example

### On prem
- building www.my-online-store.com
- docker image deployed on cluster as a POD on a deployment
    - "wear" POD
- deploy a mysql database POD, with a ClusterIP svc (accessible inside cluster)
    - "mysql-service" svc
- deploy a NodePort svc for pod
    - "wear-service"
    - port 38080
    - can now be accessed via https://<node-ip>:38080
- configure your DNS to point my-online-store to your node-ip
    - can now be accessed via https://www.my-online-store.com:38080
- deploy proxy server 
    - proxies requests to port 80 to port 38080 on your nodes
    - point DNS to the server
    - PODs can now be accessed via https://www.my-online-store.com

### Switch to GCP

- change "wear-service" to type LoadBalancer
    - gcp deploys proxy 80 to all your nodes at 38080
    - you update DNS so my-online-store points to gcp's load balancer IP
    - PODs can still be accessed via https://www.my-online-store.com

### add another service split my-online-store.com/wear and my-online-store.com/video
- don't want to add another proxy to route to a new proxy for /video and /wear

**Ingress**
- lets you route to different services based on the requested URL
- also implements SSL
- "layer 7 load balancer" built-in to the cluster
- *still need to publish it with a NodePort or a gcp LoadBalancer*

## Ingress
1. Deploy Ingress controller
- implemented w nginx, haproxy or traefik
- not deployed by default!
2. Configure with Ingress resources

### Ingress Controller
- start with deployment defn file
    - "nginx-ingress-controller"
    - 1 replica
    - nginx-ingress template
    - image: quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress.controller:0.21.0
    - args:
        - /nginx-ingress-controller
        - --configmap=$(POD_NAMEPSACE)/nginx-configuration

- then a NodePort service
    - route all traffic on ports 80 and 443 to nginx-ingress deployment

- configmap for the controller deployment

### Ingress resource
- *ingress rules* let you configure which subdomains or paths should be served by which services
- have a separate rule for each host or domain name
    - within each rule, you define which path goes where

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wear-watch
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /wear
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: wear-servoce
                port: 80
          - path: /watch
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: watch-service
                servicePort: 80
```
- can also configure by domains with spec.rules.host

### Annotation: rewrite-target
- the video POD is serving on video on /
- but the request is my-website.com/watch
- we want the request to be served by the video POD, and for it to get the target "/"
- this is what `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /` lets us do
    - replacing whatever is under spec.rules.http.paths.path with the value in rewrite-target (`/`)
